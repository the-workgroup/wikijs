title: Palship Program in Gaza
description: The idea of palship was discovered independently by few individuals midst the Gaza war. In this page, I would like to present a safe and a scalable, decentralised model that worked well for me and many others.

# Safe Palship Program

## Ù‘Introduction

> Gazans are mere not numbers to outsiders, and outsiders are not mere "money transfers" and "GoFundMe campaigns" to Gazans, we are in this together, this is **palship**, which is the kind of solidarity the world needs for this war to end

**The goal of palship** is to move outsiders (you, reading this post) from being a spectator of the Gaza death camp, to being a witness.

**The goal of palship** is to cultivate a fiest-hand understanding, of how wars (like this one) are _sustained_ and _financed_, for you to become a beacon of peace in the world, when this war is over.

**Hence, the ultimate goal** is to convert you, the pal, from a social media actor to an actual advocate of peace and harmony...

> Remember that many of your most favourite children books, were actually written by World War II soldiers who have seen so much death and destruction and needed to heal themselves, and here we are, in 2024, able to witness a genocide from afar, and by doing so, we can all be in the same place as those soldiers. Having seen children blown into bits on camera, hanging from a steel rod, remains eaten by dogs, head wide open, and bodies flattended... This pain we all carry from these images, will only make us realise that we do not want it for anyone, we want all the children to live. This realisation (and the immense healing behind it) will make us enders rather than reciprocators, of violence, aggression, and murder.

## More information
### Pitch

Do you find yourself nowadays scrolling endlessly on social media? With feed full of atrocities that are being comitted by the Israeli army in Gaza?

Did you find yourself in the past months, acting impulsively, donating 50, 100, or 150 USD to someone's campaign, wondering if this money, as hard as it is to you to make, has left an impact or helped refuel the stomachs and/or the spirit of those in the Gaza death camp?

Do your feelings of helplessness leading to other symptoms in your life, making you more sad, less excited, less focused, less inspired, etc.

Then we have a solution for you.

### Eye-to-Eye Solidarity

We propose starting a genuine relationship with a Gazan family. No hiding behind donations. You help them financially, yes, but most importantly, you call them like you would call your biological family and you open up to them.

As you do that, you will understand their pain when they lose a family member, and they will understand your agony and helplessness when living in a Zionist-controlled economy.

You both will exchange symmetrical and true solidarity, and it is going to change you and change them (said from experience).

### Action Type

This is not a casual action you are taking here, it requires a lot of communication and a fair amount of commitment. It is not for those greedy with their time, or greedy with their money, either.

It also requires creating clear boundaries and protecting yourself, which will prove to be a great skill, and help both the family and the pal grow as people, become more generous, and more accomodating, while also remaining disciplined towards themselves.

### Action Location

This solidarity can be achieved using the phone as a communication channel and digital currency as a financial channel, that is totally decentralised, and protects the identity of the Gazans.

### Action Duration

To start, you can agree to a fixed term of 3 months, to see how you feel and how your Palestinian family feels. If this works, it can be extended.

We find that creating a framework or boundaries, whether it is a minimum amount weekly or an initial commitment period, will help those new to palship protect themselves by embedding some of the boundaries in the framework of palship.

### Mentorship

As you start, you can always reach out to your mentor (someone who has been doing this more than you do), and they can check on your boundaries, in terms of how much money and time you are giving, whether it is stretching you, and advise you on ways to communicate your boundaries.

Note that Gazans can be a combination of demanding and sensitive, as they are proud people, but eventually, can do this successfully and it will reault in a genuine and a solid connection that can last a lifetime.



Hello! My name is Orwa Diraneyya and I would like to invite you to doing something that I have been doing since the beginning of the Gaza war, which is to speak to one Gazan family that you consider "your own".

The relationship with the family can either be open-ended or for a fixed term that can be renewed (for example, 3 months).

The relationship is based on solidarity, which involves speaking over the phone at least once a week, texting, and offering financial support in a way that is safe and secure.

The weekly amount can be anything from 15 USD to 60 USD, depending on the family and the financial situation of the pal.

## What you need to do to get started

- Decide on whether you want to commit yourself to being a pal
- Be prepared to learn new digital skills (to buy and send digital currency)
- Be prepared to use a telephony-over-internet app on your phone
- Choose a weekly amount that is comfortable for you
- Choose between open-ended palship or a fixed-term that can be renewed (e.g. 3 months)
- Be willing to be involved emotionally with people in a war zone, while seeing them as your own family
- Be prepared to open up, share, and receive as much as give in this interaction. Otherwise it will not feel genuine to the Gazans, and will not feel respectful. They are very proud and very generous people.
