title: Palship Program in Gaza
description: The idea of palship was discovered independently by few individuals midst the Gaza war, including American comedian Sammy Obaid who tried to scale up the idea, unsuccessfully in my opinion. I am Orwa, and I would like to propose a safer model here.

# Safe Palship Program

Hello! My name is Orwa Diraneyya and I would like to invite you to doing something that I have been doing since the beginning of the Gaza war, which is to speak to one Gazan family that you consider "your own".

The relationship with the family can either be open-ended or for a fixed term that can be renewed (for example, 3 months).

The relationship is based on solidarity, which involves speaking over the phone at least once a week, texting, and offering financial support in a way that is safe and secure.

The weekly amount can be anything from 15 USD to 60 USD, depending on the family and the financial situation of the pal.

## What can I offer

I can teach the Gazans how to receive digital currency and to teach you how to send digital currency. This is the safest and the most robust way to send money to Gaza at the moment.

## What you need to do to get started

- Decide on whether you want to commit yourself to being a pal
- Be prepared to learn new digital skills (buy and send digital currency)
- Choose a weekly amount that is comfortable for you
- Choose between open-ended palship or a fixed-term that can be renewed (e.g. 3 months)
- Be willing to be involved emotionally with people in a war zone, while seeing them as equals
- Be prepared to open up, share, and receive as much as give in this interaction. Otherwise it will not feel genuine to the Gazans, and will not feel respectful. They are very proud people.
