title: Palship Program in Gaza
description: The idea of palship was discovered independently by few individuals midst the Gaza war. In this page, I would like to present a safe and a scalable, decentralised model that worked well for me and many others.

# Welcome to Palship!

## Ù‘Introduction

> Gazans are not mere numbers to outsiders, and outsiders are not mere "money transfers" or "GoFundMe campaigns" to Gazans. We are in this together, and this is **palship** - a kind of solidarity that the world needs to end this war.

The goal of palship is to move outsiders (you, reading this post) from being a spectator of the Gaza death camp, to being a witness. We aim to cultivate a first-hand understanding of how wars (like this one) are sustained and financed, so that you can recognize the signs and become a beacon of peace in the world, when this war is over.

> Many of your favorite children's books were written by World War II soldiers who had witnessed so much death and destruction. Upon returning to their families and civil lives, they wrote to heal themselves. Now, in 2024, we are able to witness a genocide from afar. Technology has allowed us to see, upclose, gruseome scenes of children, men, women and elderly being literally blown into bits. Having seen all this at such high fidelity, we are in the same place as those WW II soldiers, carrying the pain and healing from the images we saw, and realizing that we do not want such violence for anyone, or anyone's children.

## Still reading?

If you are still reading, good! This means that you are interested, so let me pitch the action to you, and tell you more about what it entails, for you, the action taker. 

### Pitch

Do you find yourself scrolling endlessly nowadays on social media? With a feed full of atrocities that are being comitted by the Israeli offense army in Gaza?

Did you find yourself in the past months, acting impulsively, donating 50/100/150 USD to someone's campaign, wondering if this money, as hard as it is for you to make, has left an impact or helped refuel the stomachs and/or the spirit of some of those in Gaza?

Do you feel helpless, and is this helplessness leading to other symptoms in your life, making you more sad, less actionable, less productive, less excited, less focused, less inspired, etc.

Then I have an option for you, and it is a good option if you can do it.

### "Palship"

My proposition to you is to start a genuine relationship with a Gazan family. In doing so, you will not be hiding behind a donation button. You will help them financially, yes, but most importantly, you will call them like you would call your biological family, and you will try to open up to them as much as you can.

As you do that, you will understand their pain when they lose a family member, and they will understand your agony and helplessness when living in an economy under (direct or indirect) Israeli control.

You both will exchange symmetrical and true solidarity, and it is going to change you both (said from experience).

### Action Type

This is not a casual action you are taking here, it requires a lot of communication and a fair amount of commitment. It is not for those not willing to invest enough time, or greedy with their money, either.

It also requires creating clear boundaries and protecting yourself, which will prove to be a great skill, and will help you and your Palestinian family grow as people, become more generous, and more accomodating, while also remaining disciplined towards ourselves.

### Action Location

This solidarity action does not require a specific location, all you need is a smartphone and two applications, one for communication and the other for sending digital currency.

### Action Duration

To start, you can begin with a fixed term of 3 months, to see how and your Palestinian family feel about the exchange. If this works for both of you, then this fixed-term can be extended.

We find that creating a framework, in the form of a _weekly donation_ or _fixed-term for the palship_ can help some people protect themselves until they develop the skills needed to state their own boundaries clearly and empathetically. This is done by embedding some of the boundaries in the framework of palship.

This, however, does not mean that the pal can get away with having leaky boundaries, as people in a war zone tend to always ask for more. Hence, a mentor can always come in handy.

### Mentorship

As you start, you can always reach out to your mentor (someone who has been doing palship for a little longer than you have). They can help you do a "boundary-check" by asking about the amount of money and time you have been giving, and whether it is more than what you are willing to give. If you are stretched, the mentor can help and guide you on kind ways to communicate your boundaries to your family.

As we start this journey, it's important to remember that living in different circumstances can make it challenging to fully understand the thoughts and feelings of people in Gaza. How can we continue to develop our empathy and humanity, and examine our own reactions and perceptions?

Remember, palship is not a one-way street. It requires a commitment to understanding and empathizing with your Palestinian family, just as you would with your own. By doing so, you can build a genuine and meaningful relationship that benefits both parties.

### Financial Support

The weekly amount can be anything from 15 USD to 60 USD, depending on the family and the financial situation of the pal.

## How do I get started (action checklist)

- [X] Decide on whether you want to commit yourself to being a pal
- [X] Be prepared to learn new digital skills (to buy and send digital currency)
- [X] Be prepared to use a telephony-over-internet app on your phone
- [X] Choose a weekly amount that is comfortable for you
- [X] Choose between open-ended palship or a fixed-term that can be renewed (e.g. 3 months)
- [X] Be willing to be involved emotionally with people in a war zone, while seeing them as your own family
- [X] Be prepared to open up, share, and receive as much as give in this interaction. Otherwise it will not feel genuine to the Gazans, and will not feel respectful. They are very proud and very generous people.
