<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>These are some ideas for actions that can be done at demonstrations or at other times. Some ideas are more related to direct action and others are more playful. &nbsp;They may require some preparation to create costumes, props, and learn how to improvise and role-play in the group of people who are performing. It's also helpful to invite other people along to film, pass out flyers and talk with the audience during or after the action. Friends can also play part of the audience, because when one person stops to stare, it starts a precedent and kind of gives permission for others to stop and stare, too. Trial and error and adapting to the place and situation is vital to make any action successful.</p>

          <h2>Waiters with olives from Gaza</h2>
          <p>Dress impeccably as waiters with trays of olives and offer them to people passing in the streets. “Would you like an olive from Gaza? There's a surplus after settlers cut down the trees." When the people get angry, tell them that you only represent a company that's implicit in genocide. If they would like to complain, please take this card with the number of the boss…&nbsp;<br>The card can also have a link to a petition against the company, or any of the BDS / boycott websites.<br><i>Olives are common in Spain and easy to prepare. Maybe other things are better in other cultures.</i><br>&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Rubble from Gaza</h2>
          <p>Put rubble in cardboard boxes. Find rocks and dirt in the forest or broken cement from construction sites or abandoned houses. Carry the boxes with the opening facing down and leave them on the street or the entrance of a building and leave quickly. When the security guards lift the boxes, the rubble falls out automatically. A paper inside can say FROM GAZA, or on the box itself.&nbsp;<br>Someone can film with their mobile phone from a discrete distance.</p>

          <h2>Flamenco in banks</h2>
          <p>Any type of local folk dance with singing could get the attention of the people and give you more of a platform for listening to your complaints and demands. Flamenco worked well in Spain because it is very passionate and people across all spectrums generally enjoy it. Flamenco also only requires clapping and stomping and a strong voice lamenting one's situation.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iop2b3oq1O0">youtube.com/watch?v=iop2b3oq1O0</a></p>
