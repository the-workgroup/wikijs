title: QR Code in Public Spaces
description: This project is about the spread of a physical QR code that serves relevant content at the time of scanning. Unlike social media profiles and posts, this QR Code offers a rare opportunity to host otherwise-censored content to defy ironclad war propaganda.

# Welcome to the Public QR Code!

> This a **draft action** and not accepting volunteers, yet

The material to which the QR code takes should be relevant at the time of scanning, and hence the link should be dynamic.

The host serving the link should ideally be a tunnel protecting the actual server from abuse, as it is likely that the link will be the object of a ferocious attack, at one point or another.
