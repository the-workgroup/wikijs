title: QR Code in Public Spaces
description: This project is about the spread of a physical QR code that serves relevant content at the time of scanning. Unlike social media profiles and posts, this QR Code offers a rare opportunity to host otherwise-censored content to defy ironclad war propaganda.

# Welcome to the Public QR Code!

> This a **draft action** and not accepting volunteers, yet

The QR code movement is an attempt to physically print out and spread a QR code in public spaces that hosts changing (i.e. dynamic) _revealing content_ that otherwise would be censored on social media.

It does so in a manner that is respectful, and while seeking consent for gruesome media in the form of a blurry image that can be revealed with a single click .

The material to which the QR code takes should be relevant at the time of scanning, and hence the link should be dynamic.

The content should be 2-3 paragraphs with 2-3 images/videos highlighting how real and alarming the situation is.

The URL embedded in the code should map flexibly to the actual server hosting the content (i.e. it should be pointed to it using a DNS that is under out control) to be able to change hosts when they are taken down.
