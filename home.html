<h1>Welcome to The Workgroup's Wiki</h1>
<p><i>The Workgroup</i> is a place where people can promote their own actionable humane practice, take action on someone else's initiative, or craft a collaboration between two autonomous humane efforts.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The word “humane”, in this context, is borrowed from <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/">CHT</a>'s course “Foundations of Humane Tech” but while being applied more generally to all efforts, online and in real life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The Workgroup</i> offers governance tools, communication infrastructure, and resourcefulness in the form of engagement opportunities for everyone. We also offer education on how to start and sustain any level of autonomous humane practice.</p>
<h2>Current Initiatives</h2>
<p>Below is a table with the current initiative. Each initiative will have an <strong>action template</strong> and will allow you to get in touch with someone to help you get started.</p>
