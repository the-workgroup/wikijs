<h1>Welcome to The Workgroup's Wiki</h1>
<p><i>The Workgroup</i> is a place where people can start their own humane practice, join someone else's, or craft a collaboration between two autonomous efforts.</p>
<p><i>The Workgroup</i> offers governance tools, communication infrastructure, and resourcefulness in the form of engagement opportunities for everyone.</p>
